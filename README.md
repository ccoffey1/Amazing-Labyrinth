To run the game simply CD to the directory of the "runnable_game.jar" file and pass the following command into your terminal:

java -jar runnable_game.jar <name of person 1> <name of person 2> <name of person 3> <name of person 4>

Example: java -jar runnable_game.jar Christian John Paul Lorela

You may have less than four players, but not more than four players. A less-technical way to run the game is coming soon!
Rules for the game are as follows:

Players must shift the board tiles using the tile in their inventory at the start of their turn. They may rotate the tile as they see fit
prior to sliding it onto the board. The player must then navigate--but may not return to their starting position. Each player's primary goal is to 
gather as many tokens as possible in numerical order. That is, at the start of the game players must attempt to acquire token 1. If, say, player 1 
acquired this token, player 2 would then seek token number 2, and so on. Each token is worth it's value in points, so token 1 is 1 point, token 2 is 
worth 2 points, and so on. The last token is unique as it is worth 25 points--despite there being only 21 tokens!

Players, additionally, may use one of their 3 magic wands at the conclusion of their turn and grant themselves an additional turn! 
Unfortunately, however, this feature isn't enabled at this current point in time.

That's the basic rundown. The rules become more apparent once the game is played.

Thanks for playing!
